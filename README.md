## Test

## Calculations

The calculation is based on solving a quadratic equation.

## Ticks

After calculating sqrtRatioLowX96 and sqrtRatioUpperX96, the resulting values of tickLower and tickUpper ​​have to be rounded (up and down, respectively) to the nearest permitted tick, taking into account the parameter tickSpacing of pool.
